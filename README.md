# Net Ninja Vue 3

## Purpose

Store the applications I created while working through the Net Ninja's Vue 3 playlist.

## Projects

- **dojo-blog:** Final project in the playlist, this is a half-formed blog project. The rest likely occurs in the Udemy course created by Shaun P (the Net Ninja). I may see what I can create on my own. _Uses `data/db.json` and the node package `json-server` to mock a NoSQL DB API._

- **ninja-jobs**: A simple job board used to demonstrate the capabilities of the Vue Router. This also uses the `data/db.json` and `json-server` approach to mock a DB API.

- **nn-reactiontimer**: A basic single view Vue app to play around with the use of components and passing data back and forth between components and views.

- **nn-v3**: A simple Vue 3 app with a basic Modal component. Getting started with Vue 3.

- **web-form**: Examining how the reactive data binding in Vue 3 can be used in working with HTML forms. I took a slightly different approach and nested the individual `form` properties within a `form: {} ` object because I find it can reduce code verbosity.
